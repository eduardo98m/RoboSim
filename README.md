# RoboSim

RoboSim (ROBOtics + SIMulator) is a projects that aims to create an easy to use and easy to customize rigid body physics simulator for robotics applications. The project is currently under early development.

## Installation

**Note:** These instructions have been tested on Linux, but there should be no problems following them on Windows (or Mac) as well.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

### Installing RoboSim

To install RoboSim, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository recursively:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/your_username/RoboSim.git
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd RoboSim
```
3. Use CMake to build the project :

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
